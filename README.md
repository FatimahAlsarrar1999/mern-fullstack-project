This repository is meant to be empty. You currently have a working frontend and backend in two different repositories.


For this assignment, you would keep them the way they are (separated), meaning you would run them separately and have them talk to each other.


This repository is to open a PR and leave a comment to share the links of your frontend and backend PRs that you already have (from previous assignments).

Common mistakes (try to avoid):


- Not having a plan
- Not follow the plan planned by you or the instructor (you could utilize Trello to follow progress)
- Spending too much time on a feature or styling which would block all other tasks
  - You could simply ask in the tech channel (what is the problem and what have you done to solve it)
  - Simple, skip it.
  - Do anything but blocking your time in solving a problem that doesn't really make any huge impact or not in your interest to learn or improve
  - Not being active or proactive when you have a common problem.
